# Machine Learning for the Detection of Network Attacks

I am using the CICIDS2017[1] dataset to apply machine learning-based techniques to be able to detect
network attacks and work towards a final model by evaluating several different algorithms.
The aim was to then implement an intrusion detection system, to sniff traffic and in real-
time classify whether or not the traffic is benign or adverse.
