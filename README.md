# Machine Learning for the Detection of Network Attacks

I am using the CICIDS2017[1] dataset to apply machine learning-based techniques to be able to detect
network attacks and work towards a final model by evaluating several different algorithms.
The aim was to then implement an intrusion detection system, to sniff traffic and in real-
time classify whether or not the traffic is benign or adverse.

Using a random forest classifier I achieved 99.91% accuracy and a 97.59% F1 Score. 

The python notebook (main.ipynb) contains my initial investigation; preprocessing the data set, feature selection, evaulating a variety of different algorithms, and optimising hyperparameters.
